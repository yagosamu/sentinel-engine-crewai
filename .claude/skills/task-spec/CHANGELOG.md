# Changelog

All notable changes to the **task-spec** skill are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Version numbers follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) where MAJOR is the spec format version,
MINOR is additive format/feature changes, and PATCH is bug fixes / doc clarifications.

The canonical version string lives in `scripts/_lib.sh` (`TASKSPEC_VERSION`) and is
duplicated in `SKILL.md` frontmatter (`version:`). The doc-consistency lint
(`scripts/lint-skill-docs.sh`, ships in v2.1.0) asserts the two match.

## [2.2.1] — 2026-06-03

The **eval-runner stdin-hang fix** (PATCH). Pushes the v2.2 format from the 9.0
sign-off to **9.5** by closing the last reachable robustness gap: the eval runner
could block forever waiting on stdin. Same format, harder substrate.

### Fixed

- **`scripts/run-task-spec.sh` — eval runner no longer hangs on stdin.** The
  per-eval invocation (`bash -c "source …; eval_N"`) inherited the gate-runner's
  stdin. An eval body containing `read` — or any construct that consumes stdin —
  would **block indefinitely** waiting for input that never arrives, hanging the
  whole gate (and any CI dispatch reading its JSON). Both the per-eval runner and
  the Exit Check runner now redirect stdin from `/dev/null`, giving immediate EOF.
  This is load-bearing: the new `B:reads-stdin` fuzz case provably HANGS (killed
  at the 8s timeout, RC=137) with the per-eval guard removed and completes
  cleanly with it. The Exit Check guard is defense-in-depth (a malformed Exit
  Check body fails at script-build time, not on a stdin read), kept for symmetry
  with the per-eval path.

### Changed

- **Removed dead `overall_pass` accumulator** from `run-task-spec.sh`. It was set
  on per-eval failure but never read — the final verdict is the Exit Check's exit
  code, per the `signed_off` contract. shellcheck SC2034 surfaced it; deleting the
  vestigial state is cleaner than annotating it.

### Added

- **`tests/test-extractor-fuzz.sh` — adversarial fuzz of the extract-and-run
  path** (19 cases). (A) extraction correctness on heredoc-heavy bodies (arith
  `<<`, delimiter literally `bash`, fake fences/headers inside heredocs, nested
  and quoted heredocs); (B) robustness invariant (never hang, never leak a raw
  bash/awk/sed error) including the load-bearing `reads-stdin` case; (C)
  defense-in-depth coverage of the Exit Check runner. Honors `--version` via
  `ts_version_flag` (doc-lint Check 4).

---

## [2.2] — 2026-06-02

The **key-optional HMAC sign-off envelope** release (B2). The crypto deferred in
v2.1.1 is now HERE. `safe-to-delegate.sh --stamp` seals a real HMAC-SHA256 over a
canonical payload; `validate-task-spec.sh` Check 17 recomputes and compares.
Sign-off is no longer trivially forgeable by hand-edit — closing the gap the
`T-20260603-fake-envelope.md` fixture documented.

### Added

- **`scripts/_lib.sh` crypto floor.** `ts_sha256` and `ts_hmac_sha256` detect a
  provider in priority order (openssl → `shasum -a 256` → `sha256sum`). When only
  a plain sha256 tool is present, HMAC is built manually via the RFC-2104
  ipad/opad construction (block size 64) — byte-for-byte identical to
  `openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac KEY`. When NONE of the three providers exists the
  helpers return a sentinel and the gate degrades to structural-only (Tier 2);
  a missing crypto binary NEVER produces a broken install or a hard error.
  Adds `ts_resolve_signing_key`, `ts_keyid`, `ts_spec_body`, `ts_body_digest`,
  `ts_signoff_payload`, `ts_compute_signoff_sig`.
- **`scripts/safe-to-delegate.sh --stamp` now seals `signed_off_sig`.** After
  writing the three plaintext `signed_off*` lines, it computes HMAC-SHA256 over a
  canonical fixed-field payload (`id`, `body_digest` = sha256 of the spec body
  after the closing frontmatter `---`, `signed_off`, `signed_off_by`,
  `signed_off_at`) and writes `signed_off_sig: hmac-sha256-v1:<keyid>:<hex>`. The
  signed set EXCLUDES the `signed_off_sig` line itself and is independent of
  frontmatter line ordering, so the MAC verifies on the very next read.
- **`scripts/validate-task-spec.sh` Check 17 three-tier degrade.** The structural
  floor is unchanged. When a key + sig are present the MAC is recomputed and
  compared. **Tier 1** (key + sig + MAC verifies) = full crypto trust, exit 0;
  **Tier 2** (no key, or sig absent = legacy spec) = structural-only with a loud
  warning, exit 0 (never hard-fails for a missing key); **Tier 3** (MAC mismatch
  or malformed sig) = hard FAIL exit 1, "DO NOT DELEGATE: spec body or envelope
  modified after stamping".
- **`configs/setup-taskspec-signing-key.sh`** generates a 256-bit key, writes it
  chmod-600 to `.git/info/taskspec-signing-key` (when `.git` is a real directory)
  or prints `TASKSPEC_SIGNING_KEY` instructions (worktree `.git` is a FILE), and
  prints the keyid. Stored OUTSIDE version control.
- **Key resolution** (`ts_resolve_signing_key`): env `TASKSPEC_SIGNING_KEY` (file
  path → read it; else raw key material), then `.git/info/taskspec-signing-key`
  only when `git rev-parse --git-dir` resolves to a real directory, then no key
  → Tier 2.
- **Tests & fixtures.** `tests/test-hmac-envelope.sh` (keyed Tier-1/2/3 suite +
  portability-floor masking + `.git/info` fallback), wired as
  `tests/test-task-spec-skill.sh --suite hmac`. New fixtures
  `T-20260603-stamp-then-verify.md` and `T-20260603-tampered-body.md` (keyed,
  excluded from the default no-key oracle so the existing 15 fixtures still
  behave as before).
- **Schema.** `references/schemas/task-spec-frontmatter.schema.json` now declares
  the real `signed_off_sig` contract (pattern `hmac-sha256-v1:<keyid>:<hex>`,
  what it covers, key-optional). The previously-dead `signed_off_envelope` object
  stub is re-described as reserved for a future per-author detached-signature
  upgrade.

### Changed

- **`references/concepts/signed-off.md`** rewritten: crypto is HERE now (not
  "planned for v2.2"). Honest IS/IS-NOT — HMAC is symmetric, so it binds "a
  repo-key holder stamped this", NOT per-author non-repudiation (an asymmetric
  Ed25519/DSSE upgrade is the named future hardening). Threat model = an
  adversarial co-author who read the skill, not a remote supply-chain attacker.
  Documents the three tiers and the Tier-2 supervised-only policy.
- **`runbooks/dispatching-a-task-spec.md`** adds the mandatory sign-off-tier gate:
  Tier 2 is read/inspect/triage only — NOT dispatch-eligible for unsupervised
  crank — closing the downgrade-bypass (run the verifier without the key to reach
  the forgeable Tier-2 state). `safe-to-delegate.sh` surfaces the tier in VERDICT.

### Security

- HMAC is symmetric: a repo-key holder can forge a Tier-1 stamp. The envelope
  defends against an adversarial co-author who hand-edits an envelope or a silent
  post-stamp edit — NOT against an attacker who already holds the key. Per-author
  non-repudiation is explicitly out of scope and deferred to a future asymmetric
  upgrade.

### Fixed (round-5 adversarial review)

- **Shell-injection in the crypto-sealing path (HIGH).** `safe-to-delegate.sh`
  wrote `signed_off_by` via a `sed s|…|${STAMP_BY}|` substitution. A `--stamp-by`
  / `$USER` value containing `|` silently FAILED to seal while the gate still
  printed "Tier 1 crypto trust" (the `sed … && mv` chain suppressed `set -e`); an
  `&` silently mis-attributed the sign-off WITH a valid seal. Fixed by routing
  every envelope field (including `signed_off_sig`) through one injection-safe
  primitive, `ts_set_frontmatter_field` in `_lib.sh`, which carries the value via
  `awk -v` (never a sed delimiter). The five adversarial inputs (`build|42`,
  `a&b`, `team/build`, a full `s|.*|INJECTED` payload, an embedded space) are now
  regression-locked in `test-hmac-envelope.sh` Scenario 7.
- **Conformance suite silently no-op'd on bash 3.2 (HIGH).**
  `tests/conformance/run_conformance.sh` discovered fixtures with `mapfile`
  (bash-4-only). On macOS system bash 3.2 it printed "mapfile: command not found",
  left the fixture array empty, and reported success while testing NOTHING.
  Rewritten as a bash-3.2-safe `while read` loop so the vendor-facing conformance
  gate runs on the portability floor; `test-bash-portability.sh` section (d) now
  asserts the runner + adapters carry no bash-4-only constructs.

### Changed (round-5 adversarial review)

- **Tier-2 "supervised-only" is now an enforced control, not just prose.**
  `safe-to-delegate.sh` emits a machine-readable `TIER=N` line for a signed spec,
  and a new `--require-tier1` flag makes the gate exit non-zero on anything below
  Tier 1 — so a CI dispatcher branching on `$?` cannot crank a Tier-2 spec
  unsupervised. Documented in `runbooks/dispatching-a-task-spec.md`; covered by
  `test-hmac-envelope.sh` Scenario 8.
- **Cross-engine equivalence proof strengthened (B3).** The Python-vs-TypeScript
  oracle compared `eval_count` (a number) and four scalars. It now compares the
  FULL ORDERED `eval_ids` list and a canonicalized `validation_card` projection
  (`agent_contract` zones, `retry_policy`, success-criteria), so two consumers
  that find the same COUNT of evals but disagree on WHICH evals now diverge.
- **Worktree key-path docstrings corrected.** `_lib.sh` and
  `setup-taskspec-signing-key.sh` wrongly implied a worktree's `.git` being a file
  skips the `.git/info` key path. `git rev-parse --git-dir` resolves to the
  per-worktree gitdir, so the key IS found there — the comments now describe the
  real behavior (proven by the `.git/info` fallback test running in this worktree).

### Fixed (round-6 re-review — hardening the round-5 fixes)

- **`ts_set_frontmatter_field` now rejects multi-line values.** A value containing
  a newline or CR is refused with a clear error (return 2) and the file is left
  untouched — closing a residual injection path (a multi-line scalar would inject
  an extra frontmatter line). Regression: `test-hmac-envelope.sh` S9.
- **`ts_set_frontmatter_field` now hard-fails on un-writable frontmatter.** A spec
  with no closing `---` previously left the field silently unwritten while
  returning 0; the caller would then HMAC a spec missing the field. The awk now
  signals "not written" (`END { if (done==0) exit 3 }`) and the function returns
  1 with a clear error; `safe-to-delegate.sh` BLOCKs rather than sealing a
  half-stamped spec. Regression: `test-hmac-envelope.sh` S9.
- **Cross-engine oracle now normalizes whole-number floats** (`30.0` → `30`) so a
  YAML numeric-typing difference between the Python and TypeScript parsers cannot
  produce a false divergence in `test-portability-e2e.sh` Step 7.

### Fixed (round-7 convergence review)

- **`awk -v` escape-expansion injection closed (HIGH).** Round-6 rejected literal
  newline BYTES, but `ts_set_frontmatter_field` still passed the value via
  `awk -v`, which runs C-escape processing — so the two characters backslash+n
  (no newline byte, so the round-6 guard let it through) were expanded by awk
  into a real newline, injecting a forged extra frontmatter line via `--stamp-by`.
  The value is now carried through the process environment (`ENVIRON[]`), which
  does NO escape processing: every byte (`|`, `&`, `\`, backslash-n, tab) is
  written verbatim as one scalar. The primitive's docstring "verbatim incl. `\`"
  guarantee is now true. Regression: `test-hmac-envelope.sh` S9 case (c).
- **Conformance results.json write now fails loud on bash 3.2 (LOW).** A redirect
  failure on the `{ … } > results.json` brace group does not trip `set -e` on
  bash 3.2, so an unwritable target produced a green run with a stale artifact.
  The write goes via a temp file whose presence + a regular-file check on the
  destination are verified explicitly; any failure is a `FATAL` exit 1.

### Fixed (round-8 convergence — temp-file symlink hardening)

- **Symlink-following on the predictable `.$$` temp-write path closed (LOW).** The
  in-place editors write to a predictable sibling temp (`<file>.fmset.$$` /
  `.tmp.$$`) then `mv` it over the original. A shell redirect `> "$tmp"` follows
  a pre-existing symlink, so an actor with write access to the directory could
  plant one to clobber an arbitrary target. New `ts_prepare_tmp` helper (`_lib.sh`)
  `rm -f`s the temp path before every redirect at all five sites
  (`ts_set_frontmatter_field`, `validate-task-spec.sh`, `transition-status.sh`,
  `rebuild-state.sh`, `run_conformance.sh`), so the redirect always creates a
  fresh regular file. Scoped LOW — the temp is a repo-internal sibling, not in
  world-writable `/tmp` — but closed for defense-in-depth. Regression:
  `test-hmac-envelope.sh` S9 case (d).

## [2.1.1] — 2026-06-02

The "shippable for any agent" hardening release. Closes the 8 bugs surfaced by
the round-2 adversarial review of v2.1 and ships the cross-engine artifacts
(JSON schemas, reference consumers in Python and TypeScript, per-engine
dispatch recipes, RFC-2119 contract + conformance fixtures) that turn the
"vendor-portable" claim from rhetoric into a testable spec.

### Retraction — "HMAC envelope" was misleading

The v2.1.0 entry below described the `signed_off` envelope check as an "HMAC
envelope." That naming was wrong and is **retracted**. The check is a
**structural sign-off envelope**: it asserts that `signed_off: true` is
accompanied by `signed_off_by` and `signed_off_at` lines populated by
`safe-to-delegate.sh --stamp`. It catches the dominant failure mode
(accidental hand-stamping) but does **not** provide cryptographic protection
against adversarial hand-stamping — anyone with write access to the file can
populate the three lines manually and bypass the check. The `tests/fixtures/
T-20260603-fake-envelope.md` fixture documents this limitation by example.
Real HMAC crypto (with key management + rotation) is deferred to v2.2; until
then, every doc, error message, and code comment that previously said "HMAC"
now says "structural sign-off envelope."

### Added

- **WS-A — P0 silent-failure patches (Bugs 1, 2, 5).** `validate-task-spec.sh`
  now uses safe-default capture (`${var:-}`) for the three `signed_off*`
  reads, so a missing `signed_off_by:` line under `signed_off:true` produces
  a loud `hand-stamping detected` error at exit 1 instead of a 0-byte
  silent abort under `set -euo pipefail`. `safe-to-delegate.sh --stamp`
  no longer silently no-ops when envelope lines are absent — it now
  appends missing `signed_off_by:` and `signed_off_at:` lines via an
  `awk`-based frontmatter injection before the closing `---`.
  `tests/test-task-spec-skill.sh` Step 1 was broken since v2.1's
  generator-output rename (looked for `>>> Created`, generator now prints
  `Spec written:`); fixed to the new contract and locked by a new
  `tests/test-generator-output-contract.sh` regression guard.
- **WS-B — Generic inverted-eval lint (Bugs 3, 4).** `validate-task-spec.sh`
  Check 16 collapses the per-command regex stack (`grep -c`, `wc`, etc.)
  into a single coherent rule: any `$(...)` or backtick substitution
  followed by `|| (true|echo <int>)` within 4 lines of a numeric `-eq/-ne/
  -lt/-le/-gt/-ge` test against the captured variable, when the variable
  is not normalised via `${var:-0}` or `${var//[^0-9]/}`, fails validate.
  Catches backticks, `awk`, `python3`, `jq`, and any future substitution
  tool with one rule instead of whack-a-mole. New umbrella allowlist
  `# task-spec:allow-numeric-fallback` covers the legitimate exceptions.
- **WS-C — Honest renaming.** The "HMAC envelope" terminology was
  swept across `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `references/concepts/signed-off.md`,
  `references/concepts/agent-contract.md`, `agents/task-architect.md`,
  `runbooks/dispatching-a-task-spec.md`, `runbooks/first-spec-walkthrough.md`,
  `tests/test-portability-e2e.sh`, `tests/test-task-spec-skill.sh`,
  `scripts/validate-task-spec.sh`, `scripts/generate-task-spec.sh`, and
  `tests/conformance/T-conformance-003-no-signed-off-mod.md` and replaced
  with "structural sign-off envelope." A new honest paragraph in
  `references/concepts/signed-off.md` describes the limitation and the
  v2.2 crypto options. A new `tests/fixtures/T-20260603-fake-envelope.md`
  fixture proves the bypass and is itself the documentation: yes, this is
  possible; here is how; we say so out loud. CHANGELOG keeps the historical
  v2.1.0 entry intact (no retroactive edits) and adds this retraction
  paragraph above it.
- **WS-D — Backlog-dir consistency + dogfood lint (Bugs 6, 7).**
  `transition-status.sh` now writes the metrics ledger to
  `$TASKSPEC_BACKLOG_DIR/_metrics.jsonl` instead of the hardcoded
  `tasks/_metrics.jsonl` — the skill now follows its own published rules
  about backlog-dir configurability. A new `ts_metrics_path()` helper in
  `_lib.sh` is the single source of truth so future ledger writers cannot
  re-introduce the drift. The dead `warn_count=$(echo ... | grep -c '^\s\+-'
  || true)` assignment in `safe-to-delegate.sh` (the gate using the very
  anti-pattern it bans) is deleted. `lint-skill-docs.sh` adds **Check 10**:
  run the Check 16 regex set against every `scripts/*.sh` (excluding
  `validate-task-spec.sh` itself, which contains the regexes as string
  literals) and assert zero matches. The skill now eats its own dog food.
- **WS-E — Machine-readable schemas + reference consumers (G1, G6).**
  `references/schemas/task-spec-frontmatter.schema.json` and
  `references/schemas/agent-contract.schema.json` (JSON Schema draft
  2020-12) mirror the validator's Check 2 / 2b / 2c and the validation-card
  YAML block. `references/schemas/README.md` ships copy-pasteable
  validation snippets for Python (`jsonschema`), Node (`ajv`), Go
  (`gojsonschema`), and Rust (`jsonschema`). `references/examples/
  consume-task-spec.py` (~100 LOC, stdlib-only) and `consume-task-spec.ts`
  (~120 LOC, `yaml`+`ajv`) prove that any agent — Python, Node, anything
  with a JSON Schema validator — can parse a Task-Spec, extract its
  agent contract, enumerate eval blocks, and return a structured object
  **without invoking bash**. New `validate-task-spec.sh --emit-schema
  {frontmatter|agent-contract}` flag is the single source of truth so
  engine vendors can pin a specific schema version. `tests/
  test-portability-e2e.sh` extends with a schema-fidelity step that runs
  the Python consumer against the golden fixture and asserts exit 0
  with correct field extraction.
- **WS-F — Per-engine dispatch recipes (G2).** New
  `runbooks/dispatch-recipes/` directory ships one recipe per
  `execution_backend` enum value: `claude-code.md` (`Task()` tool
  invocation, `agent_contract.read` zone consumption, terminal-output
  reporting), `codex.md` (Codex CLI + `codex_metadata` + exit-code
  conventions), `kimi.md` (Kimi-specific content extracted from the old
  Kimi-centric runbook), `gemini.md` (generic LLM CLI / completion API
  path), `taskship.md` (taskship-specific command), `anthive.md`
  (parallel-session dispatch + `output_artifacts` capture), and
  `custom.md` (the DIY escape hatch + v2.2 `dispatch_recipe:` field
  reference). Each recipe is bounded to ~80 LOC and structured
  identically (Prerequisites / Dispatch / Status reporting / Failure
  modes / See also). `runbooks/dispatching-a-task-spec.md` is rewritten
  as a **router** with a "Pick your engine" jump table at the top — the
  Kimi-centricity critique is closed.
- **WS-G — RFC-2119 contract + conformance suite (G4).**
  `references/concepts/agent-contract.md` "The contract" section is
  rewritten with explicit RFC-2119 verbs (MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD,
  SHOULD NOT, MAY). 38 keywords now appear in the contract document
  (target was ≥10). A new "Conformance Test Suite" section enumerates
  the synthetic scenarios any engine claiming Task-Spec support must
  pass, and `tests/conformance/` ships **6 conformance fixtures**
  (`T-conformance-001-status-lock.md` through
  `T-conformance-006-do-not-touch.md`) designed to be vendored by
  engine authors into their own test suites. New `tests/conformance/
  README.md` documents the vendoring protocol. A new "What this
  contract does NOT cover" section in `agent-contract.md` lists the
  deliberate non-requirements (e.g., engines MAY use any internal LLM
  model; the contract is execution-side, not generation-side).

### Changed

- **Version bumped to 2.1.1** in `scripts/_lib.sh` (`TASKSPEC_VERSION`)
  and `SKILL.md` frontmatter (`version:`). `plugin.json` and
  `marketplace.json` version fields bumped to match.
- **`lint-skill-docs.sh` now runs 10 checks** (was 9). The new Check 10
  is the WS-D dogfood lint — same regex set as `validate-task-spec.sh`
  Check 16, applied to the skill's own `scripts/*.sh`.
- **`runbooks/dispatching-a-task-spec.md` rewritten as a router**, with
  per-engine details delegated to `runbooks/dispatch-recipes/*.md`.
- **`references/index.md` (and `runbooks/first-spec-walkthrough.md`
  Step 7) updated** to point at the new recipe files and schema docs.

### Fixed

- **Bug 1.** Missing `signed_off_by:` under `signed_off:true` no longer
  produces a 0-byte silent abort.
- **Bug 2.** `safe-to-delegate.sh --stamp` no longer silently no-ops on
  specs missing the envelope lines.
- **Bug 3.** Backtick form of the inverted-grep-c pattern is now caught
  by the generic Check 16 rule.
- **Bug 4.** `awk`, `python3`, `jq`, and any other substitution tool
  with a numeric-fallback footgun is now caught by the same rule.
- **Bug 5.** Default `tests/test-task-spec-skill.sh` invocation (no
  `--suite` flag) runs to completion past Step 1.
- **Bug 6.** `transition-status.sh` honors `TASKSPEC_BACKLOG_DIR` for
  the metrics ledger.
- **Bug 7.** Dead `warn_count` assignment using the banned inverted
  pattern removed from `safe-to-delegate.sh`.
- **Bug 8 (honesty).** "HMAC envelope" terminology is retracted and
  replaced with "structural sign-off envelope" everywhere except the
  v2.1.0 CHANGELOG entry (which is preserved as historical record).

### Deferred to v2.2

- **Real HMAC crypto on the sign-off envelope** (with key management +
  rotation). Requires a real secrets-management surface — `.git/info/
  task-spec-key`, gitignore policy, "what if key missing" UX. The
  v2.1.1 rename + the `T-20260603-fake-envelope.md` fixture proving
  the limitation are honest enough for this release; the crypto upgrade
  is the v2.2 unlock.
- **`dispatch_recipe:` custom-engine frontmatter field.** Requires a
  frontmatter schema bump. Holding until at least one real "custom"
  engine asks for it. `runbooks/dispatch-recipes/custom.md` documents
  the v2.2 path so vendors know what to expect.
- **Bash 3.2 vs 5.x + macOS / Linux / WSL matrix CI.** Requires
  GitHub Actions infra wiring. Local `test-portability-e2e.sh` is
  sufficient for v2.1.1; matrix CI is the next-level proof.
- **`scripts/conformance-check.sh <engine-binary>` driver.** Presupposes
  WS-G's conformance fixtures exist (this release ships them as files).
  Build the driver in v2.2 once vendors actually want it.
- **Property-based eval fuzzer.** The WS-B generic rule + 4 new
  inverted-eval fixtures cover the observed variants. Property fuzzer
  adds combinatorial coverage; deferred to v2.2 per the v2.1.0 CHANGELOG.
- **MCP self-provisioning preflight.** Failure mode is loud
  (`mcp: server not found`); manual install remains acceptable.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-06-02

The "no rough edges" hardening release. Closes the four defects exposed by the
ADF Decimal pilot crank and Codex adversarial review.

### Added
- **Single canonical version field.** `version: "2.1.0"` in `SKILL.md` frontmatter
  and `TASKSPEC_VERSION="2.1.0"` in `scripts/_lib.sh`. Every top-level script
  sources `_lib.sh` and supports `--version` printing `task-spec v2.1.0`.
- **CHANGELOG.md** (this file). Required to bump for every release per the format
  change protocol documented in `_lib.sh`.
- **`scripts/_lib.sh`** — shared bash helpers (path resolution, error printing,
  version handler). Single source of truth for version + skill root + configurable
  `TASKSPEC_BACKLOG_DIR`.
- **Inverted-grep-c lint** (WS4) — `validate-task-spec.sh` rejects 6 known
  inverted-eval-count variants (e.g. `count=$(grep -c X file || echo 0)` produces
  the literal string `"0\n0"` on zero matches, breaking integer comparison).
- **Eval-inversion fixture suite** (WS5) — `tests/fixtures/` ships 7 minimal
  fixture specs + `oracle.json` declaring expected verdicts, consumed by
  `tests/test-task-spec-skill.sh --suite fixtures`.
- **`safe-to-delegate.sh --stamp` is now THE named gate** (WS3) — the
  documented author flow points at the gate, not at the structural-only
  `validate-task-spec.sh`. New `references/concepts/signed-off.md` explains the
  autonomy contract; new `runbooks/dispatching-a-task-spec.md` closes the loop.
- **Portable distribution** (WS6) — `plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` ship at
  the skill root; `scripts/install.sh` rewrites for fresh-tempdir installability;
  `TASKSPEC_BACKLOG_DIR` env var overrides hardcoded `tasks/` for downstream users.
- **First-spec walkthrough + portability e2e smoke test** (WS8) — a new author
  at a new repo can follow `runbooks/first-spec-walkthrough.md` and produce a
  `signed_off: true` spec on first attempt; `tests/test-portability-e2e.sh`
  enforces it in CI.
- **Doc-consistency lint** (WS10) — `scripts/lint-skill-docs.sh` blocks future
  v1/v2 drift, version mismatches, and missing distribution files.

### Changed
- **All docs canonicalised to v2.1.** Every `Task-Spec v1` reference outside this
  CHANGELOG was swept to `Task-Spec v2.1`. Future-tense `v2 will add` roadmap
  lines were replaced with concrete CHANGELOG entries.
- **`generate-task-spec.sh` self-validates** (WS7) — on success, runs
  `validate-task-spec.sh` against its own output and prints a `Next: ...
  safe-to-delegate.sh --stamp ...` breadcrumb so authors are never lost between
  generation and gating.
- **`task-architect` agent template aligned** (WS9) — references v2.1,
  `execution_backend`, `signed_off`, and contains the "never hand-stamp" rule.

### Fixed
- **`validate-task-spec.sh:362` self-trip.** The script itself used
  `PLACEHOLDER_COUNT=$(grep -c '{{TODO' "$FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)` — exactly
  the inverted-grep-c pattern the new lint catches. Rewritten using
  `${count:-0}` normalisation so the lint catches zero legitimate code in the
  skill itself.

### Deferred to v2.2
- MCP self-provisioning preflight (failure mode is loud; manual install
  acceptable for v2.1).
- Property-based eval fuzzer (curated fixture oracle suffices for v2.1).
- Per-file authorized-fields intent gate (belongs in the broker, not the spec
  skill).
- Backfill of v1/v0 CHANGELOG history (see git history).
