# Conformance — MUST acquire lock before status change (C1)

> **Why:** Exercises agent-contract clause C1: "An engine MUST acquire the
> lock via `transition-status.sh` (or an equivalent atomic operation) before
> modifying the `status:` frontmatter field." This fixture proves the engine
> serializes status transitions atomically and cannot be tricked into a
> split-brain state by a concurrent claimer.

## Goal

Demonstrate that, when two engine instances race to claim this same spec,
exactly one acquires the lock and transitions `status: ready` to
`status: in_progress`. The loser MUST observe the new status and abort
without overwriting it.

## Context

This is a VENDORED conformance fixture, not a real task. Engine authors copy
this file into their own test suite, then drive it through their engine
twice concurrently. A conformant engine produces a single winner.

The expected behavior is encoded in the success criteria so the spec itself
is the oracle.

## Success Criteria

```bash
eval_1() {
  test -f tests/conformance/_workdir/c001.log
}

eval_2() {
  test "$(grep -c 'claim_won' tests/conformance/_workdir/c001.log)" -eq 1
}

eval_3() {
  test "$(grep -c 'claim_aborted_status_not_ready' tests/conformance/_workdir/c001.log)" -ge 1
}
```

## Validation Card

```yaml
success_criteria:
  - id: eval_1
    description: log file exists
    runnable: bash
    check_type: deterministic
    terminal: false
    expected_duration_sec: 1
  - id: eval_2
    description: exactly one engine won the claim
    runnable: bash
    check_type: deterministic
    terminal: false
    expected_duration_sec: 1
  - id: eval_3
    description: loser observed the new state and aborted
    runnable: bash
    check_type: deterministic
    terminal: true
    expected_duration_sec: 1

```

## Exit Check

```bash
eval_1 && eval_2 && eval_3
```

## Rollback Plan

Delete `tests/conformance/_workdir/c001.log` and re-run.

## Observability Hooks

Engine MUST append one of `claim_won|claim_aborted_status_not_ready` per
attempt to the log so the race outcome is auditable.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't read-then-write `status:`** — that's not atomic; use the lock helper.
- **Don't suppress the loser's error** — the loser MUST exit cleanly with the abort log line.
- **Don't grant the lock by default** — a permissive lock invalidates C1.
