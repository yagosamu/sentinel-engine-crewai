# Conformance — SHOULD honor execution_backend; MAY override with justification (C8)

> **Why:** Exercises agent-contract clause C8: "An engine SHOULD honor
> `execution_backend` declared in the validation card, but MAY override
> with explicit justification logged to the metrics ledger."

## Goal

Demonstrate that:

- If the engine matches `execution_backend: codex`, it executes under
  Codex and logs `backend_used: codex` to the metrics ledger.
- If the engine is something else (e.g., Kimi) and chooses to override, it
  MUST log `backend_override: {from: codex, to: <name>, reason: <text>}`
  with a non-empty reason.

Either path is conformant. Silent override is NOT conformant.

## Context

This is a VENDORED conformance fixture. Engine authors copy it into their
own test suite. If the engine has multiple backends, run this fixture twice:
once where the declared backend matches and once where it doesn't.

## Success Criteria

```bash
eval_1() {
  test -f tests/conformance/_workdir/c004_metrics.jsonl
}

eval_2() {
  jq -r 'select(.backend_used != null) | .backend_used' \
       tests/conformance/_workdir/c004_metrics.jsonl | grep -q 'codex' \
  || jq -e 'select(.backend_override.reason != null and .backend_override.reason != "")' \
       tests/conformance/_workdir/c004_metrics.jsonl >/dev/null
}

eval_3() {
  jq -r 'select(.backend_override != null) | .backend_override.from' \
       tests/conformance/_workdir/c004_metrics.jsonl | grep -qx 'codex' \
  || true
}
```

```

## Exit Check

```bash
eval_1 && eval_2 && eval_3
```

## Rollback Plan

Truncate `tests/conformance/_workdir/c004_metrics.jsonl` and re-run.

## Observability Hooks

Engines MAY emit additional telemetry (token counts, cost estimates), but
the ledger record is the source of truth for conformance.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't override silently** — that strips the audit trail.
- **Don't lie about `backend_used`** — the value MUST reflect the actual model that produced the work, not the declared preference.
- **Don't log empty `reason` strings** — those are equivalent to silent override.
