# Conformance — MUST emit one of the four terminal states (C12)

> **Why:** Exercises agent-contract clause C12: "An engine MUST emit exactly
> one of `{pass, fail, retry_with_reason, parked_with_context}` per
> attempt." Downstream consumers depend on this closed set; a rogue value
> like `error` or `unknown` breaks every ledger reader.

## Goal

Demonstrate that, given three evals where two pass and one fails (with
budget remaining), the engine emits `retry_with_reason` — not `error`,
`fail_with_message`, `incomplete`, or any other value outside the four-value
enum.

## Context

This is a VENDORED conformance fixture. Engine authors copy it into their
own test suite, run it through their engine, and inspect the metrics ledger
line they produced. The ledger MUST contain a JSON record whose `outcome`
field is one of the four allowed strings.

## Success Criteria

```bash
eval_1() {
  test -f tests/conformance/_workdir/c002_metrics.jsonl
}

eval_2() {
  jq -r '.outcome' tests/conformance/_workdir/c002_metrics.jsonl \
    | grep -Eq '^(pass|fail|retry_with_reason|parked_with_context)$'
}

eval_3() {
  jq -r '.outcome' tests/conformance/_workdir/c002_metrics.jsonl \
    | tail -1 | grep -qx 'retry_with_reason'
}

eval_4() {
  test "$(jq -r '.reason' tests/conformance/_workdir/c002_metrics.jsonl | tail -1)" != "null"
}
```

## Validation Card

```yaml

  - id: eval_1
    description: ledger exists
    runnable: bash
    check_type: deterministic
    terminal: false
    expected_duration_sec: 1
  - id: eval_2
    description: every outcome is in the four-value enum
    runnable: bash
    check_type: deterministic
    terminal: false
    expected_duration_sec: 1
  - id: eval_3
    description: last outcome is retry_with_reason
    runnable: bash
    check_type: deterministic
    terminal: false
    expected_duration_sec: 1
  - id: eval_4
    description: reason field is populated
    runnable: bash

    - fail
    - retry_with_reason
    - parked_with_context
  codex_metadata: {}
  kimi_metadata: {}
```

## Exit Check

```bash
eval_1 && eval_2 && eval_3 && eval_4
```

## Rollback Plan

Truncate `tests/conformance/_workdir/c002_metrics.jsonl` and re-run.

## Observability Hooks

Engine MUST write one JSON record per attempt with at least
`{outcome, reason, eval_results}` keys.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't invent new outcomes** (`error`, `incomplete`, `aborted`). Use the four allowed values.
- **Don't conflate `fail` with `retry_with_reason`** — `fail` is "evals failed and engine surrenders this attempt"; `retry_with_reason` is "evals failed and engine will retry, here is why".
- **Don't omit `reason`** when emitting `retry_with_reason` — that defeats the auditability story.
