# Stamp-then-verify — proves the HMAC payload boundary (Tier 1)

> **Why:** Keyed fixture for the B2 HMAC sign-off envelope. This spec is NOT in
> the default no-key oracle. It is stamped under an ephemeral key by
> tests/test-hmac-envelope.sh, then verified immediately. A successful verify
> proves the canonical payload boundary is self-consistent: the MAC reads the
> three signed_off* values the stamper just wrote, excludes the signed_off_sig
> line itself, and does not depend on frontmatter line ordering — so it verifies
> on the very next read (Tier 1, full crypto trust).

## Goal
Prove that safe-to-delegate.sh --stamp produces a signed_off_sig that
validate-task-spec.sh Check 17 immediately verifies at Tier 1 when a signing key
is present.

## Context
B2 keyed fixture. Stamped + verified by tests/test-hmac-envelope.sh with an
ephemeral TASKSPEC_SIGNING_KEY. With NO key it degrades to Tier 2 (structural
only), which is why it is excluded from the default no-key oracle.

## Success Criteria
```bash
eval_1() {
  ! grep -q 'NEVERMATCH' README.md
}
```

## Validation Card

## Rollback Plan
(none — fixture)

## Observability Hooks
(none — fixture)

## Anti-Patterns
- **Don't ship this fixture as a real task.** It is a keyed regression artifact for the B2 HMAC envelope.
- **Don't add it to the default no-key oracle.** Without a key it is Tier 2, not Tier 1; the keyed behaviour belongs in tests/test-hmac-envelope.sh.
- **Don't hand-edit signed_off_sig.** The autonomy contract is produced by safe-to-delegate.sh --stamp.
