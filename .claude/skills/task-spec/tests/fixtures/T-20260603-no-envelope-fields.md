# signed_off true with no envelope fields at all

> **Why:** Hand-stamper set signed_off:true but DELETED the signed_off_by/signed_off_at lines — Bug 1 silent-exit fix must still fire the envelope error

## Goal
Synthetic v2.1.1 fixture used by tests/test-task-spec-skill.sh --suite fixtures.

## Context
WS5 oracle entry; expected verdict declared in tests/fixtures/oracle.json.

## Success Criteria
```bash
eval_1() { true; }
```

## Validation Card
```yaml
success_criteria:
  - id: eval_1

## Exit Check

## Rollback Plan

## Observability Hooks

## Anti-Patterns
- **Don't ship this fixture** — regression test only.
- **Don't bypass with --skip flags** — lint must fire under defaults.
- **Don't trust the eval** — the whole point is the lint catching it.
