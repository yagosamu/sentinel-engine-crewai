# Legacy pre-v2 spec with no signed_off line at all

> **Why:** Legacy spec authored before v2.1 envelope existed — validate must NOT fire the envelope error (signed_off line absent means default false)

## Goal
Synthetic v2.1.1 fixture used by tests/test-task-spec-skill.sh --suite fixtures.

## Context
WS5 oracle entry; expected verdict declared in tests/fixtures/oracle.json.

## Success Criteria
```bash
eval_1() {
  ! grep -q 'NEVERMATCH' README.md
}
```

## Validation Card
```yaml
success_criteria:
  - id: eval_1

## Exit Check

## Rollback Plan

## Observability Hooks

## Anti-Patterns
- **Don't ship this fixture** — regression test only.
- **Don't bypass with --skip flags** — lint must fire under defaults.
- **Don't trust the eval** — the whole point is the lint catching it.
