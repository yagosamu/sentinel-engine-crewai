# Tampered body — Tier 3 hard-fail under a key

> **Why:** Keyed fixture for the B2 HMAC sign-off envelope. This spec is NOT in
> the default no-key oracle. tests/test-hmac-envelope.sh stamps it under an
> ephemeral key (sealing signed_off_sig), then edits ONE character of the BODY
> below and re-verifies. Because the body_digest in the canonical payload no
> longer matches the sealed MAC, validate-task-spec.sh Check 17 must hard-FAIL
> at Tier 3 with "DO NOT DELEGATE: spec body or envelope modified after
> stamping". With NO key, this same edit is invisible (Tier 2) — which is the
> whole point of the v2.2 crypto upgrade.

## Goal
Prove that any post-stamp modification to the spec body (or to a signed_off*
value) is caught at Tier 3 when a signing key is present.

## Context
B2 keyed fixture. The TAMPER-TARGET line below is the single character the
keyed test mutates after stamping. TAMPER-TARGET: original-marker-do-not-edit

## Success Criteria
```bash
eval_1() {
  ! grep -q 'NEVERMATCH' README.md
}
```

## Validation Card

## Rollback Plan
(none — fixture)

## Observability Hooks
(none — fixture)

## Anti-Patterns
- **Don't ship this fixture as a real task.** It is a keyed tamper-detection artifact for the B2 HMAC envelope.
- **Don't add it to the default no-key oracle.** Without a key the tamper is undetectable (Tier 2); the Tier 3 behaviour is proven only in tests/test-hmac-envelope.sh under a key.
- **Don't re-stamp after tampering in the test.** The test asserts the FAIL; re-stamping would mask the regression it guards.
