# Forged structural envelope — validate accepts (v2.1.1 honest limit)

> **Why:** Honest-limitation fixture for the v2.1.1 rename. A spec author with
> knowledge of the structural sign-off envelope shape can populate
> `signed_off: true` + `signed_off_by: luan` + `signed_off_at: 2026-06-03T00:00:00Z`
> by hand and `validate-task-spec.sh` will accept it. This fixture exists to make
> that gap visible. Real cryptographic protection lands in v2.2.

## Goal
Document the v2.1.1 limitation: the structural sign-off envelope check catches
*accidental* hand-stamping (the common ADF Decimal pilot failure mode where
`signed_off_by` is `(none)` or `signed_off_at` is empty / non-ISO-8601), but it
does NOT catch *adversarial* forgery by an author who reads
`references/concepts/signed-off.md`, learns the envelope shape, and hand-stamps
plausible values. v2.2 will close this gap with a real keyed message
authentication code (or equivalent detached signature) over the spec's
structural fields, keyed by a per-author or per-repo secret and validated by
both `safe-to-delegate.sh` and downstream supervisors.

## Context
WS-C fixture, paired with the `## [2.1.1]` CHANGELOG entry and the new
"What the envelope IS and IS NOT" paragraph in
`references/concepts/signed-off.md`. Oracle declares `expected_exit=0` and
`expected_match="OK:"` — the structural lint is intentionally permissive of
this forgery; flagging it would require crypto, not a string check.

## Success Criteria
```bash
eval_1() {
  ! grep -q 'NEVERMATCH' README.md
}
```

## Validation Card

## Rollback Plan

## Observability Hooks

## Anti-Patterns
- **Don't ship this fixture as a real task.** It is a documentation artifact for the v2.1.1 honest limitation; it is not work to be cranked.
- **Don't read this fixture as permission to hand-stamp.** The autonomy contract is produced by `safe-to-delegate.sh --stamp`. Hand-stamping defeats the gate even when the structural lint accepts the spec — the lint is a tripwire, not the trust anchor.
- **Don't wait for v2.2 to start using v2.1.1.** The accidental-hand-stamping case is the empirically-observed failure mode (ADF Decimal pilot). Adversarial forgery is the theoretical concern v2.2 will harden against.
