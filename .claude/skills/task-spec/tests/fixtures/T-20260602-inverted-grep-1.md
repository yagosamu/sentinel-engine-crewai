# Inverted grep -c with echo 0 fallback

> **Why:** Pattern 1: $(grep -c X file || echo 0) produces 0\\n0 on zero matches

## Goal
Synthetic v2.1 fixture used by tests/test-task-spec-skill.sh --suite fixtures.

## Context
WS5 oracle entry; expected verdict declared in tests/fixtures/oracle.json.

## Success Criteria
```bash
eval_1() {
  count=$(grep -c 'NEVERMATCH' README.md || echo 0)
  [ "$count" -eq 0 ]
}
```

## Validation Card
```yaml

## Rollback Plan

## Observability Hooks

## Anti-Patterns
- **Don't ship this fixture** — regression test only.
- **Don't bypass with --skip flags** — lint must fire under defaults.
- **Don't trust the eval** — the whole point is the lint catching it.
